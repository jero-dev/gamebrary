# LADR 1: Documenting Design and Architectural Decisions

## Context

In the course of a software project, there are many decisions that need to be made. These decisions can be about the design of the software, the architecture of the software, or the implementation of the software. These decisions can have a significant impact on the success of the project, and it is important to document them so that they can be reviewed and understood by everyone that wants to dive in the project.

Apart from that, it's true that we don't want to have an heavy and long documentation, so we need to seek for a light way to record it and make it accessible.

## Decision

After doing some research, we took the decision of using [LADR (Light Architecture Decision Records)](https://github.com/peter-evans/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) for documenting the design and architecture decisions.

Also, we added the [Discussions section](https://github.com/jero-dev/gamebrary/discussions) for anyone that wants to bring new options and opinions for improvement.
